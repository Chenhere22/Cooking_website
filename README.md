**Business Model**: Users can choose from three subscription plans. The basic plan only allows viewing recipes and preparation steps. The intermediate plan includes video access and a chatbot customer service. The premium plan offers live online classes and the opportunity to participate in offline seminars.

**Marketing & Distribution**: I have about 1,600 followers on YouTube and TikTok combined. I can promote the website on my social media channels. Additionally, I can participate in local food-making interest groups on a volunteer basis to increase visibility. During festivals and holidays, I can distribute or post stickers with the websiteâ€™s QR code in high-traffic areas.

**Target Audience**: Japanese and Korean culture have a significant influence in Europe, and a growing number of young people are interested in Asian cuisine, especially Japanese and Korean food.

**Use Case**: Non-Asian food enthusiasts who love Asian dishes might look for recipes before a gathering, aiming to prepare authentic and impressive foreign cuisine to share with friends.

**Flagship Course Offerings**: Dumplings, sushi, miso soup, ramen, spring rolls, and gimbap.
